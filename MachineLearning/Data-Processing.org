* Logistic Regression
- Result is binary (win/loss)
  - throw out draws
- Estimates probability of win/loss (stays between 0-1)
** Connection to minimax
Do calculations in terms of *MAX*, so return probability that *MAX* wins. So the function should return $P(Max)$ at a terminal state for *MAX* and $1 - P(Max)$ at a terminal state for *MIN*.
* Data Export
- At a given move, difference in each piece and what the game ended up in 
| Marshall Diff | Miner Diff | Bomb Diff | Spy Diff | ... | Distance to Flag Difference | P1 Win |
|            -1 |          2 |         2 |       -1 | ... |            10               | TRUE   |
|               |            |           |          |     |                             |        |

Should we export a data point (row) for each move in each game played? or only export a sampling?
* Decisions to make
** Exporting
- How should we export the data? I was thinking just csv or txt file (see [5]) but would this be too inefficient?
- Should we consider flag difference the same as any piece? Or should it somehow be given /instant win/ status in the eval function?
** Sampling
Options:
1. At an interval? e.g. every 4th
2. after a certain number of moves
3. Every single move 
4. After each combat instance (as in [1])
Considerations
- First several will tend to be (0, 0, ..., T/F) which might not be useful
** Format
Since we are dealing with simple tuples, csv should be fine
** Piece anchoring
In chess examples, the value of a pawn is fixed at 1 so that every other piece's value is in terms of a pawn. 
- Is this necessary for us? and if so...
- Which piece do we anchor? Does it make a difference?
** Initial Evaluation Function
This will make a big difference in terms of the data that we will have to work with.
Do we need it to be normalized between 0 and 1? The function post ML will be so I think this makes sense.
