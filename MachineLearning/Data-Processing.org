* Logistic Regression
- Result is binary (win/loss)
  - throw out draws
- Estimates probability of win/loss (stays between 0-1)
* Data Export
- At a given move, difference in each piece and what the game ended up in 
| Marshall Diff | Miner Diff | Bomb Diff | Spy Diff | ... | P1 Win |
|            -1 |          2 |         2 |       -1 | ... | TRUE   |
|               |            |           |          |     |        |

Should we export a data point (row) for each move in each game played? or only export a sampling?
** Sampling
Three options:
1. At an interval? e.g. every 4th
2. after a certain number of moves
  - First several will tend to be (0, 0, ..., T/F) which might not be useful
3. Every single move 
** Format
Since we are dealing with simple tuples, csv should be fine
* Scripts
** Python
*** Libraries
- Numpy
- Scikit Learn - has Logistic regression built in
